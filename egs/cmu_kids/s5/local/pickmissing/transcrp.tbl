mjsd3an2 [noise] they remove the bark from the tree and make it into a pole 
mjsd3ao2 [noise] then they draw the faces [noise] and other markings on the pole 
mjsd3ap2 [noise] sharp tools are used to carve the pole 
mjsd3aq2 they start at the top of the pole [noise] and carve downward to the bottom [noise] 
mjsd3ar2 [noise] when the carving is finished the pole is painted 
mjsd3as2 the oil is spread all over the pole [noise] 
mjsd3at1 The oil is used to keep the pole from cracking
mjsd3au1 It takes one month to carve about ten feet of pole
mjsd3av2 if there [noise] are a lot of symbols it /M/ may take longer [noise] 
mjsd3aw2 most /T AO T IX M/ poles are between thirty and forty feet high [noise] 
mjsd3ax2 [noise] a family /T OW TH IX N/ pole [noise] may be as high [noise] as ninety feet 
mjsd3ay2 many animal signs [noise] can be found [noise] on the poles and part of their family history 
mjsd3az2 sometimes these animals stand for dances [noise] that people in /N AH/ family liked to do 
mjsd3ba2 [noise] at present totem poles are sold [noise] to people [noise] who collect them and to /M Y UW Z AE N Z/ [whisper] 
mjsd3bb2 [noise] there was a crime in alaska [noise] where someone [noise] was robbed and harmed 
mjsd3bc2 [noise] two boys have been punished for that [noise] 
mjsd3bd2 they are members of the /K L IH NG IH T/ american indian tribe 
mjsd3be2 [noise] a judge and the leaders [noise] of the tribe decided together [noise] what the punishment would be 
mjsd3bf2 [noise] the boys are being sent [noise] to live alone [noise] on islands of the coast 
mjsd3bg2 [noise] each boy will live completely alone for two years 
mjsd3bh1 Each has to build a place to live
mjsd3bi2 and they will need [noise] to cut firewood and hunt for food 
mjsd3bj2 they will have to find tools [noise] to catch and kill prey 
mjsd3bk2 [noise] a tribe leaders [noise] will come to visit from time to time to see if they [noise] are okay 
mjsd3bl2 these are the only people they will see [noise] for two years [noise] 
mjsd3bm2 [noise] /CH IY T AX Z/ are the fast /EH M EY/ animals in the world 
mjsd3bn2 [noise] scientists say that they [noise] may be extinct soon [noise] 
mjsd3bo2 years ago [noise] they were more than one hundred thousand of them [noise] in parts of africa and asia 
mjsd3bp1 Today there are less than ten thousand of them
mjsd3bq2 they are disappearing [noise] because [noise] they land they live on is now beginning [noise] used for farms and factories 
mjsd3br2 [noise] they are also killed [noise] by some of the farmers because they kill farm animals [noise] 
mjsd3bs2 some people kill them to get their [noise] skins to make coats /AE N/ other things 
mjsd3bt2 [noise] the cheetah babies [noise] are killed by lions [noise] and hyenas [noise] before they are old enough to defend them /S IH L S/ 
mjsd3bu2 [noise] for many years the /N AY T IX D/ states [noise] and russia worked separately [noise] on going into space [noise] 
mjsd3bv2 [noise] the russians took [noise] the lead thirty /Y IH/ three years ago by sending [noise] the first astronaut into space [noise] 
mjsd3bw2 after [noise] that americans won a first when neil armstrong walked on the /M/ [cut] 
mjsd3bx2 [noise] the work needed [noise] to achieve these goals at has cost the people [noise] of the two countries much money 
mjsd3by2 now they cannot spend these large amounts [noise] of money for space research 
mjsd3bz2 [noise] because of this [noise] the /Y UW EH S/ and russia [noise] will now [noise] combine their efforts with scientists [noise] of many [begin-noise] countries [end-noise] [noise] 
mjsd3ca2 they will /B UH L DD/ a space station [noise] where astronauts [noise] from around the world [noise] will be able to live /AE N/ work 
mjsd3cb2 [noise] life on space station is very different [noise] from what we are used to [noise] 
mjsd3cc2 most of the difference is because [noise] there isn't much gravity in /AA R AH DX AXR/ space [noise] 
mjsd3cd2 [noise] the force of /G R AE V AXR T IY/ attracts things to the earth's surface [noise] 
mjsd3ce2 [noise] without gravity on earth [noise] you would /N/ not be able to walk [noise] 
mjsd3cf2 you might bounce [noise] or you would float [noise] 
mjsd3cg2 [noise] gravity causes several problems in space [noise] 
mjsd3ch2 astronauts don't eat food [noise] that makes crumbs [noise] since they would float around in space stations [noise] 
mjsd3ci2 they use vacuum cleaners to get rid of any crumbs [noise] 
mjsd3cj2 [noise] drops of water in [noise] a shower are also a problem [noise] 
mjsd3ck2 they have a shower /UW M/ [noise] with a door that closes and a vacuum cleaner [noise] to get water off their bodies after they are finished [noise] 
mjsd3cl2 [noise] astronauts drop their feet [noise] to the floor [noise] when they use [noise] the toilet or the shower [noise] 
mjsd3cm2 many /EH N V AY ER M EH N T S/ [noise] make life easier /T/ for astronauts in space [noise] 
mjsd3cn2 [noise] /AE T AXR/ they are used in space [noise] people sometime [noise] find them useful on earth as well 
mjsd3co2 [noise] the astronauts drink juice and milk from /AH L UW N IX M AH M/ foil pouches 
mjsd3cp2 [noise] the pouches come filled with powder [noise] so they can be stored for long periods of time 
mjsd3cq2 /S/ someone wants a drink [noise] they add water to the pouches [noise] of /DH EH R/ choice [noise] 
mjsd3cr2 [noise] the astronauts have always [noise] had very lightweight air supplies 
mjsd3cs2 these /S/ air tanks [noise] are now being used here on earth [noise] 
mjsd3ct2 firefighters [noise] used to have [noise] very heavy air tanks [noise] that were difficult to carry around [noise] 
mjsd3cu2 [noise] they were so heavy [noise] that some people /D IH IX N TD/ use /DH AH M/ [noise] 
mjsd3cv2 this was too /D EY N JH R IX S/ [noise] so the astronauts air supply system [noise] is now used 
mjsd3cw2 astronauts need drills [noise] that are very /P AW IX F UW L/ [noise] for their work in space 
mjsd3cx2 [noise] they have a cordless drill [noise] that runs on batteries [noise] 
mjsd3cy2 [noise] people on earth now have cordless vacuum cleaners and drills 
mjsd3cz2 [noise] a space station has many parts [noise] 
mjsd3da2 [noise] a space shuttle carries the first [noise] piece of station to its [noise] position in space 
mjsd3db2 he astronauts /W AH/ work for five years building the rest of the station 
mjsd3dc2 when the station is /F IH N IX S T/ [noise] six astronauts will be able to live there at one time 
mjsd3dd2 [noise] most people will say [noise] at that station for about six months [noise] 
mjsd3de2 [noise] the parts of the /S EY ZH IX N/ [noise] where /DH/ the astronauts live are called the /HH AE P Z/ 
mjsd3df2 [noise] while at the station they will work on [noise] science experiments every day 
mjsd3dg1 There will be three science labs for this
mjsd3dh2 [noise] other experiments will be carried out on outside the station [noise] 
mjsd3di2 [noise] solar panels will collect the energy necessary [noise] for the /L EH KD T R IH S AX DX Y/ in the space station 
mjsd3dj2 [noise] noise is all around /JH Y UW/ [noise] 
mjsd3dk2 for example things that [noise] make noise every day are alarm clocks hair dryers [noise] fire trucks jet planes and loud music 
mjsd3dl2 [noise] but loud noises can be harmful [noise] 
mjsd3dm2 [noise] too much loud noise can [noise] /HH/ harm /Y ER/ ears 
mjsd3dn2 [noise] doctors say more than ten million people [noise] in the /Y UW N AY IX D/ states have hearing problems caused by loud noises 
mjsd3do2 some doctors say [noise] they are seeing more /CH IX D R IH N/ with hearing problems of that kind [noise] 
mjsd3dp2 [noise] some kids in missouri learned that everyday noises [noise] can harm their ears 
mjsd3dq2 there were special machines that [noise] kept track of noisy they heard each day 
mjsd3dr1 Some noises were very loud
mjsd3ds2 [noise] the sound of kids yelling [noise] on the school bus can be loud enough [noise] to harm kids' ears 
mjsd3dt2 [noise] noise made by video games [noise] can do harm also [noise] 
mjsd3du2 [noise] /Y ER/ ears [noise] pick up sounds made by [noise] many things [noise] 
mjsd3dv2 the sounds make tiny hairs [noise] deep inside your ear /S/ move 
mjsd3dw2 [noise] those hairs [noise] send messages [noise] to your brain [noise] 
mjsd3dx2 [noise]/then your brain tells you [noise] what sounds /Y ER/ hearing 
mjsd3dy2 loud noises can be harm [noise] to tiny hairs inside your ear 
mjsd3dz2 noise might make some of those hairs /D/ [noise] 
mjsd3ea2 [noise] then you can hear as well [noise] as you used to hear [noise] 
mjsd3eb2 [noise] one doctor says loud noises [noise] are like strong hurricane [begin-noise] winds [end-noise]
